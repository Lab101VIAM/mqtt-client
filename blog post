# Home Automation Hack: DIY MQTT Subscriber! 🏠💡

Ever felt chained to a provider's cloud service, craving a simple temperature and humidity monitor for your home? 🌡️ That was me just days ago. But then I discovered the magic of MQTT!

Wondering what MQTT is? It’s EVERYWHERE in the realm of smart sensors, wearables, and the vast world of IoT devices. Let's break it down:

## Why MQTT?
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: Requires minimal resources, perfect for even small microcontrollers. Plus, its tiny message headers optimize network bandwidth.
  
- **Scalable**: Minimal code usage means it sips power. With built-in features, MQTT can connect millions of IoT devices without breaking a sweat.
  
- **Reliable**: Designed for those pesky unreliable networks, MQTT ensures reconnection is quick and offers three quality-of-service levels to guarantee delivery.
  
- **Secure**: Encryption is a breeze with MQTT, supporting protocols like OAuth, TLS1.3, and more.
  
- **Well-Supported**: Languages like Python are MQTT-friendly. Developers can easily incorporate it with minimal coding.

## My Journey 🛤️:
1. **Setting Up the Broker**: I chose Eclipse Mosquitto, open-source and user-friendly. The broker does the heavy lifting, coordinating messages, authorizing clients, and even forwarding messages for deeper analysis.
  
2. **Subscribing with Raspberry Pi**: Leveraged the PAHO MQTT python library on my Viam-powered Raspberry Pi to listen to my IoT devices' chatter. 💻
  
3. **Sharing the Love**: The cherry on top? My module is now on the modular registry! Check out my [GitHub code](#) or directly download and test my module.

## DIY Enthusiast? Here's Your Quickstart Guide:
1. Grab a device with MQTT publishing capabilities.
2. Set up a broker to mediate the messages.
3. Install Viam on your desired device.
4. Fetch my module from the registry: [MQTT Subscriber Module](https://app.viam.com/module/bill/mqtt-subscriber).
5. Jump in and enjoy!

Bypassing cloud constraints has never been so enjoyable or community-centric. Let's innovate home automation together! 🌟🛠️
